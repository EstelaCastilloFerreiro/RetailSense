Your app idea is a SaaS-style analytics and prediction platform for retail brands and SMEs. The core value is: the client uploads their historical data (Excel/CSV, sometimes with several sheets like sales, transfers, inventory, campaigns) and the app automatically cleans it, applies a client-specific preprocessing pipeline, runs demand/pricing models, and shows a ready-to-use purchasing/pricing dashboard.
Here’s the description, then the migration approach.
1. App idea
What it does
Web app where the customer logs in and uploads one or several Excel/CSV files (different structures per customer are allowed).
The app detects sheet/column structure and applies a saved preprocessing pipeline per customer (so next time the same customer uploads, it’s automatic).
After preprocessing, the app generates a dashboard with the KPIs you defined for retail:
Projected demand by product / region / store
Optimal price per product and discount recommendations
Inventory vs forecasted demand
Top 10 products
Sales by region / store
Campaign impact and comparison
OTB metrics (number of options, depth, units, total PVP, total cost, markdown)
There is also a predictive part (ML in Python) to:
predict units to buy / produce,
optimize prices,
and recommend discounts that don’t break margin.
All of this must be done considering the financial situation and real results of the company (2023, Feb-24, Oct-24 data) because the goal is to generate profit, not just volume.
In one sentence:
A web app where a retail client uploads their data and immediately gets a purchasing plan + pricing recommendations + sales/inventory dashboard, personalized to their own data structure.
2. Why migrate away from Streamlit
Right now, in Streamlit:
the UI and the business logic are mixed in the same .py,
filters (store, family, season) are rendered directly in the sidebar,
and the dashboard is rendered inside Streamlit.
That’s good for prototyping, but you want:
a cleaner, corporate UI (your KLOB look: dark/neutral/maroon, KPIs in green/red),
a structure that supports multi-tenant (one pipeline per client),
and a frontend you can control (tabs, branding, auth).
So you want to keep the Python logic (the part that loads Excel, applies the pipeline, and runs the ML) but move the interface to something more production-like: Dash or React.
3. Migration path: Streamlit → Dash
This is the “Python-only” migration.
Idea
Keep everything in Python.
Replace Streamlit with Dash (Plotly) to get more control over layout, tabs, and callbacks.
Use your current functions (preprocess_*, your demand/pricing model, the logic that groups by family/season/store) and just call them inside Dash callbacks.
How
Extract all data logic from app.py / dashboard.py into a module, e.g. services/data_processing.py.
Build a Dash app with:
a left sidebar with dynamic filters (store, season, family),
top KPIs row,
tabbed layout:
Overview
Stores / Geography
Product / Campaigns / Returns
Inventory vs Demand
On every filter change, Dash callback → call your Python functions → return figures/tables.
This option is faster because you don’t need a separate frontend stack.
When to choose Dash
You want to stay in Python.
You don’t want to manage React/Node.
You want something closer to what you already have.
4. Migration path: Streamlit → React (+ Python backend)
This is the “real” web-app migration.
Idea
Split the app in two:
Backend (Python, e.g. FastAPI):
endpoint to upload Excel/CSV
endpoint to return filters
endpoint to return the dashboard data (KPIs, tables, chart-series) for a given section + filters
reuses the logic you already have in Streamlit
Frontend (React/Next.js):
login (later)
sidebar filters
4 tabs (the same as now)
KPI cards with corporate colors
charts in green/red depending on value
How
Take the Streamlit logic and turn it into pure Python functions that don’t call st.*.
Expose those functions via FastAPI: /upload-excel, /get-filters, /dashboard.
Build a React UI that:
shows “KLOB” top-left,
uses neutral/maroon/black for layout,
and calls the API to render each section.
Later you can add per-client pipelines (API receives client_id and loads the right preprocessing).
When to choose React
You want a SaaS product look.
You want to sell this to several brands.
You want to integrate auth, billing, roles, etc.
5. What stays from Streamlit
Your data model.
Your preprocessing.
Your demand/price logic.
Your retail KPIs.
